# Shrikant Gourh 🚀

## Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 🎉

Hi there! I'm Shrikant Gourh, a passionate enthusiast in the field of AI and Big Data Engineering. My GitHub repository is a space where I explore, experiment, and contribute to the intersection of AI and Big Data processing.

### About Me 👨‍💻
I am deeply interested in leveraging Artificial Intelligence, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), to revolutionize the way we handle and process Big Data. My goal is to push the boundaries of what AI can achieve in the realm of data engineering, making it more efficient and insightful.

### My Interests 🌟
- **AI in Big Data Engineering:** Combining the power of AI with Big Data technologies to streamline and enhance data processing capabilities.
- **Big Data Processing:** Utilizing frameworks like PySpark to manage and analyze massive datasets.
- **LLM-Driven Code Generation:** Exploring how LLMs can generate high-quality code for Big Data tasks, execute it, and return meaningful results.

### Current Focus 🔍
I'm currently working on projects that involve:
- **PySpark Code Generation and Execution:** Using LLMs to generate PySpark code for various data processing tasks, executing the code, and then using LLMs to interpret and format the results.
- **Automated Data Aggregation and Analysis:** Developing systems where LLMs not only perform aggregations and counts but also generate the corresponding code, execute it, and format the output as per the requirements.

### Vision 🌠
I believe in the potential of LLMs to generate not just accurate code but also to provide insightful interpretations of the results. By automating the code generation and execution process, we can focus more on deriving meaningful insights from data rather than getting bogged down in the mechanics of data processing.

### Get in Touch 📬
Feel free to explore my repositories and contribute to the projects. I'm always open to collaboration and discussions on innovative ideas in the field of AI and Big Data.
